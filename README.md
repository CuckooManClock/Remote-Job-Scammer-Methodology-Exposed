# Remote-Job-Scammer-Methodology-Exposed
the Methodology and TTPs of Remote Job/Pig Butchering scammers

# Stage 1 - Random Text
It starts with receiving a random vague, open ended text with something like "Are you available this week?". Why they do this is for people who might of actually handed out resumes and forgotten about those resumes or if the victim believes some form of a social service could've connected you to said job. When you respond they will introduce themselves. "I'm Mia Williams from costco and we are currently recruiting for remote positions at Costco. Training is free Easy work can be done at home must be at least 18 years old Can I send you the details and salary now?"
# Stage 2 - Meeting Upper Management
When they believe you are a "good fit" and you show a lot of interest they will redirect you to a platform where they cannot be traced IE Whatsapp, Signal, Telegram, any encrypted messenger and why they will do this would be so that the police and federal bureau cannot trace what they are about to pull on you. They will then pull whatever they are going to pull on the platform.
# Stage 3 - The Endgame
They scam you and ghost you, the end.
